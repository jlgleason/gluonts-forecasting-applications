"Notes"
"Data reflect Private Health Insurance spending on personal health care services and products (hospital care, physician services, nursing home care, prescription drugs, etc.) by state of residence. State of residence estimates account for the flow of individuals between states in order to consume health care services and present health spending based on where individuals reside rather than where they receive care."
""
"The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Office of the Actuary produces Health Expenditures by State of Residence and Health Expenditures by State of Provider every five years. The State Health Expenditure Accounts are a subcomponent of the National Health Expenditure Accounts (NHEA), the official government estimates of health spending in the United States.  "
""
"All health spending is displayed in millions of dollars."
